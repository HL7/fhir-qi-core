</h2>

<p>QDM defines Intervention and Procedure as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Intervention</em> is a course of action intended to achieve a result in the care of persons with health problems that does not involve direct physical contact with a patient.
        Examples include patient education and therapeutic communication.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Procedure</em> is an act whose immediate and primary outcome (post-condition) is the alteration of the physical condition of the subject.
        A<em> procedure</em> may be a surgery or other type of physical manipulation of a person's body in whole or in part for purposes of making observations and diagnoses or providing treatment.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure Vs Intervention</h2>

<p>
    FHIR references both of these concepts using the <em>Procedure</em> resource, specifically noting a process that involves verification of the patient's comprehension or to change the patient's mental state would be a Procedure.
    Therefore, both QDM <em>datatypes</em>, Procedure and Intervention are included in this section of the QDM to QI-Core mapping especially since all of the QDM attributes for each of these QDM <em>datatypes</em> are identical.
</p>

<h2>Procedure Vs Task</h2>

<p>
    Some use cases have considered differentiating a FHIR Procedure Resource from a FHIR core Task Resource.
    For example, should a request to perform medication reconciliation be classified as a Task or a Procedure?
    The FHIR <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/procedure.html">Procedure Resource</a> Boundaries and Relationships (Section 9.3.2) provides some distinction between a <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/task.html">Task</a> and a <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/procedure.html">Procedure</a>:
</p>

<p>
    <em>A&nbsp;</em><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/task.html"><em>Task</em></a><em>&nbsp;is a workflow step such as cancelling an order, fulfilling an order, signing an order, merging a set of records, admitting a patient.
    Procedures are actions that are intended to result in a physical or mental change to or for the subject (e.g. surgery, physiotherapy, training, counseling).
    A&nbsp;</em><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/task.html"><em>Task</em></a><em>&nbsp;resource often exists in parallel with clinical resources.
    For example, a&nbsp;</em><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/task.html"><em>Task</em></a><em>&nbsp;might request fulfillment of a&nbsp;</em><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/servicerequest.html"><em>ServiceRequest</em></a><em>&nbsp;ordering a Procedure.</em>
</p>

<p>Based on the guidance provided above, the workflow step to reconcile medication lists may be considered a Task to perform the Procedure that includes reviewing the medication list with the patient to assure it is correct and to education the patient about proper medication usage.</p>

<p>
    QDM 5.5 does not address Task; therefore, there is no direct mapping from QDM Intervention or Procedure to the FHIR Task resource.&nbsp;
    The mapping presented is from QDM to QI-Core referencing the FHIR Procedure resource.
</p>

<h2>Procedure Priority</h2>

<p>QDM 5.5 includes a new attribute for Procedure: <em>priority</em> with the following definition:</p>

<p>
    <em>Priority indicates the urgency of the procedure or the encounter referenced.
        In [electronic clinical quality measures] (eCQMs) the priority attribute will help specify elective from urgent encounters (e.g., hospital admissions) or procedures.
        Priority is a codable concept (i.e., may use a direct reference code or a value set).
        For example, priority is used to express an elective procedure or encounter from an emergency procedure or encounter.</em>
</p>

<p>
    As noted in the QDM to QI-Core Mapping for Encounter-Related Diagnoses and Procedures, a specific measure may have interest in evaluating care provided for elective procedures (e.g., hip surgery due to osteoarthritis) while excluding emergency, non-planned procedures (e.g., hip surgery due to acute fracture).
    The procedure code does not necessarily allow differentiation of the two concepts.
    A ServiceRequest.priority does have the ability to differentiate the urgency with which the <em>request</em> (or order) should be fulfilled.
    However, there is no element within the FHIR Procedure resource to address the issue.
    Encounter.priority allows specification of whether the encounter is elective.
    An encounter with Encounter.priority = <em>elective</em> <u>and </u>an Encounter.procedure.rank = 1 addresses the need to specify an elective encounter with a principal procedure.
    Therefore, based on the current use case QI-Core has not added an extension to address Procedure.priority and, as a result, there is no direct mapping from the QDM Procedure priority attribute to QI-Core.
