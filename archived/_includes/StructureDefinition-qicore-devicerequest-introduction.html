<p>The FHIR R4 and the QI-Core DeviceRequest profile describes the request to use of a device by a patient.  The device
may be any pertinent device specified in the Device resource. Examples of devices that may be requested include a
wheelchair, hearing aids, or an insulin pump. The request may lead to the dispensing of the device to the patient
or for use by the patient. Orders or recommendations for use of a device for a patient use the ServiceRequest resource.</p>
<p>To create an expression specifically requesting information that a DeviceRequest intentionally did not occur for a
medical, patient or system reason, use the profile <a href="StructureDefinition-qicore-devicenotrequested.html">QICore-Devicenotrequested</a>.</p>

<p>The following example illustrates the use of DeviceRequest:</p>
<pre>
<code>
// connectathon/fhir4/cql/AdvancedIllnessandFrailtyExclusion_FHIR4-4.0.000.cql
define "Device Indicating Frailty":
  [DeviceRequest: "Frailty Device"] FrailtyDeviceOrder
    where FrailtyDeviceOrder.status in { 'active', 'on-hold', 'completed' }
      and FrailtyDeviceOrder.intent in { 'order', 'original-order', 'reflex-order', 'filler-order', 'instance-order' }

</code>
</pre>
