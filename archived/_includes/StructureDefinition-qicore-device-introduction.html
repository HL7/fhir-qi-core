<p>FHIR defines the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/device.html">Device Resource</a> as a type of a manufactured item that is used in the provision of healthcare without being substantially changed through that activity. The device may be a medical or non-medical device.
FHIR and US Core further differentiate devices into two “classes”:
<ul>
<li>Devices that interact with the human body but do not stay in it are referred to as non-implantable medical devices.</li>
<li>Implantable devices are those which stay in the human body with a medical objective for an extended period of time, or even a lifetime.<br>

<p>The FHIR Device Resource addresses both implantable and non-implantable devices. US Core only references Implantable Device. QI-Core inherits Implantable Device from US Core and builds directly from FHIR for the QI-Core Device Resource.</p>
<p>Therefore, when creating an expression for an eCQM or a CDS artifact, assure you are using the appropriate Device or Implantable Device resource.</p>
