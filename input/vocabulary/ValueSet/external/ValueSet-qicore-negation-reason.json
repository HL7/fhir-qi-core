The value set exists to support measure developers need to reference medical, patient, and system reasons for processes not performed and it is a grouping of VSAC value sets.  Therefore, retain binding to the QI-Core value set in the profiles that use the extension.  It only exists to support bindings to capture a reason for negative.",
