  <a name="usage"><b>Usage</b></a>
  <p>FHIR defines the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/device.html">Device Resource</a> as a type of a manufactured item that is used in the provision of healthcare without being substantially changed through that activity. The device may be a medical or non-medical device.
  FHIR and US Core further differentiate devices into two “classes”:
  <ul>
  <li>Devices that interact with the human body but do not stay in it are referred to as non-implantable medical devices.</li>
  <li>Implantable devices are those which stay in the human body with a medical objective for an extended period of time, or even a lifetime.<br/>

  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>The FHIR Device Resource addresses both implantable and non-implantable devices. US Core only references Implantable Device. QI-Core uses Implantable Device from US Core. Separately, builds directly from FHIR to address non-implantable devices with QI-Core profiles as the device resource.</p>
  <p>Therefore, when creating an expression for an eCQM or a CDS artifact, assure you are using the appropriate Device or Implantable Device resource.</p>
