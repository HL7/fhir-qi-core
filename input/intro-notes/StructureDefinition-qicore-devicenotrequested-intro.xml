  <p>The DeviceRequest and DeviceNotRequested profiles represent the positive and
    negative statements for a device request. To ensure instances retrieved meet
    negative intent, applications should check the status and doNotPerform elements
    as illustrated in this example:</p>

<pre>
<code>define DeviceNotRequested:
  [DeviceRequest] D
    where D.status = 'completed'
      and D.doNotPerform() is true
</code>
</pre>
