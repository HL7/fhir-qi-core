  <p>The Procedure and ProcedureNotDone profiles represent the positive and
    negative statements for a procedure. 
  </p>


<p>The following example illustrates the use of the ProcedureNotDone profile:</p>
<pre>
<code>define "No VTE Prophylaxis Device Applied":
  [ ProcedureNotDone : "Device Application"] DeviceNotApplied
    where (DeviceNotApplied.usedCode in "Intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPC)"
      or DeviceNotApplied.usedCode in "Venous foot pumps (VFP)"
      or DeviceNotApplied.usedCode in "Graduated compression stockings (GCS)"
    )
    return
      {
        id: DeviceNotApplied.id,
        requestStatusReason: DeviceNotApplied.statusReason,
        authoredOn: DeviceNotApplied.recorded()
      }
</code>
</pre>
