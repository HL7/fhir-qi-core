  <p>The Procedure profile defines the conformance expectations for a Procedure, 
  regardless of whether it is a positive or negative statement. The ProcedureDone and ProcedureNotDone 
  profiles represent the positive and negative statements for a procedure.</p>

	<p>To create an expression indicating existence of a procedure, use the profile <a href="StructureDefinition-qicore-proceduredone.html">QICoreProcedureDone</a>; to specifically request information that a procedure intentionally did not occur for
	a medical, patient or system reason, use the profile <a href="StructureDefinition-qicore-procedurenotdone.html">QICoreProcedureNotDone</a>.</p>

<p>The following example illustrates the use of the ProcedureNotDone profile:</p>
<pre>
<code>define "Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Devices Not Applied":
  [ProcedureNotDone: "Application of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Devices (IPC)"] DeviceNotApplied
    where DeviceNotApplied.statusReason in "Medical Reason" 
      or DeviceNotApplied.statusReason in "Patient Refusal"</code>
</pre>
