  <p>The Procedure and ProcedureNotDone profiles represent the positive and
    negative statements for a procedure. To ensure instances retrieved meet
    negative intent, applications should check the status element as illustrated in
    this example:</p>

<pre>
<code>define ProcedureNotDone:
  [Procedure] P
    where P.status = 'not-done'
</code>
</pre>

<p>The following example illustrates the use of the ProcedureNotDone profile:</p>
<pre>
<code>define "No VTE Prophylaxis Device Applied":
  ["Procedure": "Device Application"] DeviceApplied
    where (DeviceApplied.usedCode in "Intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPC)"
      or DeviceApplied.usedCode in "Venous foot pumps (VFP)"
      or DeviceApplied.usedCode in "Graduated compression stockings (GCS)"
    )
      and  DeviceApplied.status = 'not-done'
    return
      {
        id: DeviceApplied.id,
        requestStatusReason: DeviceApplied.statusReason,
        authoredOn: DeviceApplied.recorded()
      }
</code>
</pre>

  <p>
  <tr>
      <td>See the <a href="patterns.html">patterns</a> page for implementation and usage patterns.</td>
  </tr>
  </p>
  <a name="examples"> </a>
  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td><a href="Procedure-negation-example.html">Negation Example with valuset</a></td><td>Procedure not performed due to complications; indicates that none of the procedures in the given not done value set were performed.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><a href="Procedure-negation-with-code-example.html">Negation Example with code</a></td><td>Procedure not performed due to complications; indicates that a specific procedure, by code, was not performed.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  </p>

  <p>Both of these example instances meet measure intent for exclusion as defined in the following example CQL:
  </p>

  <pre><code>define "No VTE Prophylaxis Device Applied":
  ["Procedure": "Device Application"] DeviceApplied
    let DeviceNotDoneTiming: Global.GetExtension(DeviceApplied, 'qicore-recorded').value
    where (DeviceApplied.usedCode in "Intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPC)"
      or DeviceApplied.usedCode in "Venous foot pumps (VFP)"
      or DeviceApplied.usedCode in "Graduated compression stockings (GCS)"
    )
      and  DeviceApplied.status = 'not-done'
    return {
      id: DeviceApplied.id,
      requestStatusReason: DeviceApplied.statusReason,
      authoredOn: DeviceNotDoneTiming
    }</code></pre>
