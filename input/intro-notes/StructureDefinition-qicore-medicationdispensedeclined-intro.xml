  <p>The MedicationDispense and MedicationDispenseDeclined profiles represent the positive and
    negative statements for a medication dispensing event. </p>


<p>The following example illustrates the use of the MedicationDispenseDeclined profile:</p>
<pre>
<code>define "Dementia Medications Not Dispensed":
  [ MedicationDispenseDeclined : "Dementia Medications"] MedicationDispenseDeclined
   where MedicationDispenseDeclined.statusReason in "Medical Reason"
      or MedicationDispenseDeclined.statusReason in "Patient Refusal"
   
</code>
</pre>
