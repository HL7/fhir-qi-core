<p>The Simple Observation and ObservationCancelled profiles represent the positive and
  negative statements for an observation. To ensure instances retrieved meet
  negative intent, applications should check the status element as illustrated in
  this example:</p>

<pre>
<code>define "Pap Test Refused":
  ["ObservationCancelled": "Pap Test"] PapTest
    where PapTest.notDoneReason in "Patient Refusal"</code>
</pre>

<p>Note that when a more specific observation, such as a Blood Pressure, is negated, the
	resource instance should conform to both the specific observation profile AND the
	general negation profile.</p>
