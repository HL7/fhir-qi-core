<a name="usage"><b>Usage</b></a>

<p>The ServiceRequest and ServiceNotRequested profiles represent the positive and
  negative statements for a service request. To ensure instances retrieved meet
  negative intent, applications should check the status and doNotPerform elements as illustrated in
  this example:</p>

<pre>
<code>define ServiceNotRequested:
  [ServiceRequest] SR
    where SR.status = 'completed'
      and SR.doNotPerform is true
</code>
</pre>

<p>
<tr>
    <td>See the <a href="patterns.html">patterns</a> page for implementation and usage patterns.</td>
</tr>
</p>
<a name="examples"> </a>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="ServiceRequest-negation-example.html">Negation Example with valueset</a></td><td>Service discontinued; indicates that none of the services in the given not done value set were requested.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="ServiceRequest-negation-example-code.html">Negation Example with code</a></td><td>Service discontinued; indicates that the given service, by code, was not requested.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>

<p>Both of these example instances meet measure intent for exclusion as defined in the following example CQL:
</p>

<pre><code>define "No VTE Prophylaxis Device Order":
  (["ServiceRequest": "Venous foot pumps (VFP)"]
    union ["ServiceRequest": "Intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPC)"]
    union ["ServiceRequest": "Graduated compression stockings (GCS)"]
  ) DeviceOrder
    where DeviceOrder.status = 'completed'
      and DeviceOrder.doNotPerform is true</code></pre>
