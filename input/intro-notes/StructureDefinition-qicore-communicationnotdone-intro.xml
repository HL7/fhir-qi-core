<b>NOTE TO BALLOT REVIEWERS:</b>
<ul>
<li>US Core 7.0, and thus QI-Core 7.0, has a new approach to USCDI requirements.</li>
<ul>
<li>As noted in the US Core 7.0 <a href='https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/must-support.html#must-support-elements'>Must Support</a> section, US Core 7.0 no longer highlights mandatory (cardinality 1..* or 1..1) and Must Support elements with a (USCDI) indicator as such items must be supported for interoperability.</li>
<li>Those USCDI elements that are not mandatory or Must Support now include an indicator (ADDITIONAL USCDI) in US Core. QI-Core 7.0 does not reference USCDI elements; rather, users should access US Core 7.0 to understand its implementation of USCDI version 4.</li>
</ul>
<li>We invite comments about the approach and suggestions for other options that would also avoid unnecessary noise or reading load to the QI-Core profile representation.</li>
<li>Further, QI-Core 7.0 does not discuss <a href='https://uscdiplus.healthit.gov/uscdi'>USCDI+Quality</a> because at the time of ballot preparation, no published version of USCDI+Quality is available. We seek reviewer advice regarding how QI-Core might address future USCDI+Quality.</li>
</ul>

  <p>This example meets measure intent for exclusion as defined in the following example CQL:</p>

<pre><code>[CommunicationNotDone: "Macular edema absent (finding)"] MacularEdemaAbsentNotCommunicated
  with "Diabetic Retinopathy Encounter" EncounterDiabeticRetinopathy
    such that MacularEdemaAbsentNotCommunicated.sent during EncounterDiabeticRetinopathy.period
      and ( MacularEdemaAbsentNotCommunicated.statusReason in "Medical Reason"
        or MacularEdemaAbsentNotCommunicated.statusReason in "Patient Reason"
      )</code></pre>
