  <p>The Immunization and ImmunizationNotDone profiles represent the positive and
    negative statements for an immunization event. To ensure instances retrieved meet
    negative intent, applications should check the status element as illustrated in
    this example:</p>

<pre>
<code>define ImmunizationNotDone:
  [Immunization] I
    where I.status = 'not-done'
</code>
</pre>

  <a name="examples"> </a>
  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="Immunization-negation-example.html">Negation Example using valueset reference</a></td>
        <td>Immunization not performed due to patient declination for religious reasons; indicates that none of the vaccines in the given "not done value set" were administered.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="Immunization-negation-example-code.html">Negation Example using coding</a></td>
        <td>Immunization not performed due to patient declination for religious reasons; indicates that a specific vaccine, by code, was not administered.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  </p>

  <p>Both of these example instances meet measure intent for exclusion as defined in the following example CQL:
  </p>

  <pre><code>define "Medical Patient or System Reason for Not Administering Influenza Vaccine":
  [Immunization: "Influenza Vaccine"] NoFluVaccine
    where NoFluVaccine.recorded during "Influenza Season Including August and September of the Prior Year"
      and NoFluVaccine.status = 'not done'
      and ( NoFluVaccine.statusReason in "Medical Reason"
        or NoFluVaccine.statusReason in "Patient Reason"
        or NoFluVaccine.statusReason in "System Reason"
        or NoFluVaccine.statusReason in "Influenza Vaccination Declined"
      )</code></pre>
