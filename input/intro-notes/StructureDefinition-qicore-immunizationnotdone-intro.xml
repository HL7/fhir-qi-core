<b>NOTE TO BALLOT REVIEWERS:</b>
<ul>
<li>US Core 7.0, and thus QI-Core 7.0, has a new approach to USCDI requirements.</li>
<ul>
<li>As noted in the US Core 7.0 <a href='https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/must-support.html#must-support-elements'>Must Support</a> section, US Core 7.0 no longer highlights mandatory (cardinality 1..* or 1..1) and Must Support elements with a (USCDI) indicator as such items must be supported for interoperability.</li>
<li>Those USCDI elements that are not mandatory or Must Support now include an indicator (ADDITIONAL USCDI) in US Core. QI-Core 7.0 does not reference USCDI elements; rather, users should access US Core 7.0 to understand its implementation of USCDI version 4.</li>
</ul>
<li>We invite comments about the approach and suggestions for other options that would also avoid unnecessary noise or reading load to the QI-Core profile representation.</li>
<li>Further, QI-Core 7.0 does not discuss <a href='https://uscdiplus.healthit.gov/uscdi'>USCDI+Quality</a> because at the time of ballot preparation, no published version of USCDI+Quality is available. We seek reviewer advice regarding how QI-Core might address future USCDI+Quality.</li>
</ul>

  <p>The Immunization and ImmunizationNotDone profiles represent the positive and
    negative statements for an immunization event. </p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="Immunization-negation-example.html">Negation Example using a valueset reference</a></td>
        <td>Immunization not performed due to patient declination for religious reasons; indicates that none of the vaccines in the given "not done value set" were administered.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="Immunization-negation-example-code.html">Negation Example using a single coded concept</a></td>
        <td>Immunization not performed due to patient declination for religious reasons; indicates that a specific vaccine, by code, was not administered.</td>

  <p>Both of these example instances meet measure intent for exclusion as defined in the following example CQL:
  </p>

  <pre><code>define "Reason for No Polio Immunization":
  ["ImmunizationNotDone": "Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)"] PolioVaccination
    where PolioVaccination.statusReason in "Medical Reason"
      or PolioVaccination.statusReason in "Patient Refusal"</code></pre>
