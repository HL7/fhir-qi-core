  <p>Both of these example instances meet measure intent for exclusion as defined in the following example CQL:
  </p>

  <pre><code>define "Reason for No Polio Immunization":
  ["ImmunizationNotDone": "Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)"] PolioVaccination
    where PolioVaccination.statusReason in "Medical Reason"
      or PolioVaccination.statusReason in "Patient Refusal"</code></pre>
