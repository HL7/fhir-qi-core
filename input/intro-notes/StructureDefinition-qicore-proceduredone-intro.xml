<b>NOTE TO BALLOT REVIEWERS:</b>
<ul>
<li>US Core 7.0, and thus QI-Core 7.0, has a new approach to USCDI requirements.</li>
<ul>
<li>As noted in the US Core 7.0 <a href='https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/must-support.html#must-support-elements'>Must Support</a> section, US Core 7.0 no longer highlights mandatory (cardinality 1..* or 1..1) and Must Support elements with a (USCDI) indicator as such items must be supported for interoperability.</li>
<li>Those USCDI elements that are not mandatory or Must Support now include an indicator (ADDITIONAL USCDI) in US Core. QI-Core 7.0 does not reference USCDI elements; rather, users should access US Core 7.0 to understand its implementation of USCDI version 4.</li>
</ul>
<li>We invite comments about the approach and suggestions for other options that would also avoid unnecessary noise or reading load to the QI-Core profile representation.</li>
<li>Further, QI-Core 7.0 does not discuss <a href='https://uscdiplus.healthit.gov/uscdiplus?id%3Duscdi_record&amp;table%3Dx_g_sshh_uscdi_domain&amp;sys_id%3D7ddf78228745b95098e5edb90cbb3525&amp;view=sp'>USCDI+Quality</a> because at the time of ballot preparation, no published version of USCDI+Quality is available. We seek reviewer advice regarding how QI-Core might address future USCDI+Quality.</li>
</ul>

  <p>The Procedure profile defines the conformance expectations for a Procedure, 
  regardless of whether it is a positive or negative statement. The ProcedureDone and ProcedureNotDone 
  profiles represent the positive and negative statements for a procedure.</p>

	<p>To create an expression indicating existence of a procedure, use the profile <a href="StructureDefinition-qicore-proceduredone.html">QICoreProcedureDone</a>; to specifically request information that a procedure intentionally did not occur for
	a medical, patient or system reason, use the profile <a href="StructureDefinition-qicore-procedurenotdone.html">QICoreProcedureNotDone</a>.</p>

<p>The following example illustrates the use of the ProcedureDone profile:</p>

<pre>
<code>define "Application of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Devices":
  ["ProcedureDone": "Application of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Devices (IPC)"]</code>
</pre>

<p>Note that the statuses indicating positive intent are implied by the use of the ProcedureDone profile.</p>
