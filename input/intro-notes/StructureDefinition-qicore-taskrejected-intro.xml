  <p>The Task profile defines the conformance expectations for a Task, regardless of whether it is a positive or negative statement. The TaskDone and TaskRejected profiles represent the positive and
    negative statements for a task.</p>

  <p>The following example retrieves requests for `Aspirin` that have been rejected for a reason:</p>

  <pre><code>define "Aspirin Rejected for Reason":
    [MedicationRequested: Aspirin] MR
      with [TaskRejected: Fulfill] T
        such that T.focus.references(MR)
          and T.statusReason in "Negation Reason Codes"</code></pre>
