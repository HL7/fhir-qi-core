introduction: >-
  The QI-Core (Quality Improvement Core Framework) Implementation Guide defines a set of FHIR profiles with extensions and bindings needed to create interoperable, quality-focused applications. The profiles in this implementation guide derive from and extend the [US Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core) profiles to provide a common foundation for building, sharing, and evaluating knowledge artifacts across quality improvement efforts in the US Realm

      No change requests have been implemented at this time; the primary focus has been on aligning QI-Core profiles with US Core. As part of this alignment, several changes have been inherited from US Core, including:
      - Removal of the US Core Birth Sex Extension from the Patient profile.
      - Deprecation and removal of the US Core Gender Identity Extension from the Patient profile.
      - Redefinition of the US Core Sex Extension, with an updated binding to Federal Administrative Sex.
